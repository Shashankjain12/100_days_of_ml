Worked on basic understanding of what is machine learning. 
Machine learning:- This is the branch of computing which means make the machine learn on the basis of some previous experiences.It involves making machine finding some correlations between data of the given inputs and outputs.So what we feed in the machine the input data and some output data as the dataset and based on that dataset our machine on the basis of certain relation set some hypothesis which determine the correlations between our data.

On the basis of that machine learning is divided on two basic types:-

1. Supervised Learning

2. Unsupervised Learning

Supervised Learning-

This is the type of machine learning in which we supervises our machine with every data so as we give our model every accurate information which information belongs to which class so as to machine will find correlations between every module.

It is of several types:-

1. Linear Regression

2. Logistic Regression or Classification

3. K-NN 

4. SVM

5. Naive Bayes

6. Decision Trees

7. Random Forest


All of these models are fed with the input and output classified with certain types

Unsupervised Machine Learning:-

This is the type of machine learning in which we don't feed machine with proper inputs and output in which they belong that means we don't have proper classification of the results.It is the sole duty of machine itself to find out those relations and predict those results.

It is of several types:-

1. Clustering 

2. Association rule learning

3. Recommender based systems
